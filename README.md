code for ICVRV2017 A virtual reality video stitching system based on mirror pyramids
# Abstract
This paper introduces a virtual reality video acquisition method based on mirror pyramids. The system is designed to capture a high-definition stereo video, while
the mirror pyramids allow users to shoot objects that are located close to the camera. First, we theoretically study the stereoscopic imaging of the specular reflection device and verify
its feasibility. Second, we propose a complete stitching process that includes calibration, mask extraction, and fusion for the
special imaging device. The mirror reflection of the 3D imaging method allows users to shoot close objects and achieve an
excellent 3D effect.
